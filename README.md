# DRIVER-DROWSINESS-DETECTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHM
The system monitors the driver's eyes using a camera; if the driver's eyes are closed for 5 consecutive frames, it identifies the driver as drowsy and issues a warning. Live video is captured and processed using MATLAB; eye segmentation and recognition are performed to assess the driver's alertness.
